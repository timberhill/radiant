`RADIAl velocity from liNe profiles simulaTor`
###### _(wild acronym by [ACRONYM](https://github.com/bacook17/acronym))_

Simulate radial velocity observations of a star using phase-dependent line profile variations and simulated planets.

## Requirements

- Python 3+
- numpy
- scipy
- PyAstronomy
- matplotlib
- progressbar _(optional)_

## Usage

Set the values in `input.config`, such as the star's mass and rotation period, planet's mass and orbital parameters, input files with the line profiles (`.s1` files), plotting and output paths and settings. The example is provided and should be used as a template, comments start with `#` symbol.
To run the simulation, run `$ python main.py` in the directory.

The example `.s1` files contain 100 line profiles each, for different phases of the rotation of the star, based on ZDI observations of Îµ Eridani with added magnetic spots. See details in _Lisogorskyi et al. 2020_.

## Example
